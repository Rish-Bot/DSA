# DSA
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing my journey and progress in mastering DSA concepts, with the aim of helping others in their learning process while also keeping myself on track.

# Purpose
The main objectives of this repository are:

Sharing Progress: Document and share my DSA progress through well-structured and thoroughly explained code.
Learning Resource: Provide a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to learn or revise DSA concepts.
Community Contribution: Offer my solutions and approaches to DSA problems to the community, fostering collaborative learning.
Personal Accountability: Maintain a record of my learning journey, ensuring consistent progress and self-improvement.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Algorithms: Contains various algorithms categorized by type (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.).
Data Structures: Includes implementations of different data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.).
Problem Solutions: Features solutions to popular DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.
Notes and Resources: Consists of my personal notes, cheat sheets, and links to useful resources for further reading.

# How to Use
Browse the Repository: Navigate through the folders to find the algorithms, data structures, or problem solutions you are interested in.
Read the Code: Each piece of code is well-commented and includes a brief explanation of the logic and approach used.
Practice and Learn: Use the code as a reference or a starting point for your own practice. Modify and experiment with it to deepen your understanding.
Contribute: Feel free to fork the repository, suggest improvements, or contribute your own solutions and implementations.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the open-source community and the numerous educational platforms that provide invaluable resources and challenges for learning DSA.
